# Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programme  (EG2605)
# Region-based style transfer and Multiple styles for segment using SAM

Credits: 
Some of the code in this project is reused from the following repos
SAM (Segment Anything Model) https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything
NST (Neural Style Transfer) https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html

The project aims to research into methods that can achieve the aims as written above: 
1. Using SAM to segment regions in a style image for style transfer to a content image
2. Using multiple style images for a segment of a content image

Functions of the ipynb files:
1. NST_segment_multiple_styles.ipynb explores the idea of choosing the 'best' style from multiple styles for a segmented region of an image
2. segment_boxes_NST_blacked.ipynb explores filling up non-segmented pixels in a segment boundary box with black pixels for use as a style image
3. segment_boxes_NST_noise.ipynb explores filling up non-segmented pixels in a segment boundary box with white pixels for use as a style image
4. segment_boxes_NST_average.ipynb explores filling up non-segmented pixels in a segment boundary box with the average intensity of segmented pixels for use as a style image
5. Segment_anything_automask.ipynb allows the user to input an image and returns the masks generated by the auto mask feature using SAM
6. segment-extract box + NST.ipynb explores using SAM to extract a boundary box and using that as a content image for NST
7. NST_segment.ipynb explores the use of a single style for a segmented region of an image
